### **Clean TS API**

This repository contains the API of the [Rodrigo Manguinho](https://www.udemy.com/user/rodrigo-manguinho/) - [NodeJs, Typescript, TDD, DDD, Clean Architecture and SOLID](https://www.udemy.com/course/tdd-com-mango/) training on udemy.

The goal of this API is to create a well defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (Test Driven Development) as a working methodology. It also uses the Clean Architecture to distribute the responsibilities between layers, always following the principles of SOLID and applying Design Patterns to solve common problems.
